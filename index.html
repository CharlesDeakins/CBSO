        <h3 class="playfair-display">History of CBSO</h3>
        <section class="profile">
            <h6 class="playfair-display">The Los Angeles Philharmonic, under the vibrant leadership of Music & Artistic Director Gustavo Dudamel, presents an inspiring array of music through a commitment to foundational works and adventurous explorations. Both at home and abroad, the LA Phil—recognized as one of the world’s outstanding orchestras—is leading the way in groundbreaking and diverse programming that reflects its artistry and demonstrates its vision. 

More than 250 concerts are either performed or presented by the LA Phil at the Frank Gehry designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, The Ford, Beckman YOLA Center, and the famed Hollywood Bowl. Collectively, the presentations at the LA Phil’s four iconic venues represent a breadth and depth unrivaled by other orchestras or cultural institutions.  

Since 2003, the LA Phil’s winter home has been the landmark Walt Disney Concert Hall, with approximately 165 performances per season. The LA Phil creates festivals, artist residencies, and other thematic programs designed to enhance the audience’s experience. Assisting with this inventive programming is composer, conductor, and creative thinker John Adams, the John and Samantha Williams Creative Chair, appointed by Gustavo Dudamel in 2009. The organization’s commitment to the music of our time is evident throughout the programming and, specifically, in the audacious Green Umbrella series and the LA Phil’s extensive commissioning initiatives. Always inspired to expand its cultural offerings, the LA Phil produces concerts each season that feature distinguished artists in recital, world music, songbook, and visiting orchestra performances, in addition to special holiday concerts and series of chamber music, organ recitals, and Baroque music. The LA Phil is also one of the premier arts organizations to offer a comprehensive jazz series, currently helmed by the legendary Herbie Hancock, the LA Phil Creative Chair for Jazz since 2009.  </h6>
